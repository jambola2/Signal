# Intended functioning

Upon pressing "Press Me", the signal should follow the Pelican Signal pattern. That is:

Green for 5 seconds

Amber for 5 seconds

Red for 5 seconds

Flashing Amber for 5 seconds

Green until being pressed again

# Errors

An existing error means that the functionality is reflected in the console with text based prompts.
There is no visual change in the "signal" and it stays green indefinitely.

To repeat, all logic can be tested via the console itself, albeit with a redundant window.
